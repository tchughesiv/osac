# OSAC Installer

This repository contains Kubernetes/OpenShift deployment configurations for the OSAC
platform, providing a fulfillment service framework for clusters and virtual machines.

> **Note:** Throughout this guide, `<project-name>` refers to your unique OSAC installation
> name, which is used as the namespace. Replace it with your chosen project name
> (e.g., `user1`, `team-a`, etc.).

## Overview

OSAC (Open Sovereign AI Cloud) provides a streamlined, self-service
framework for provisioning and managing OpenShift clusters and virtual machines. This
installer repository contains the Kubernetes/OpenShift deployment configurations needed
to deploy OSAC components on your infrastructure.

For detailed architecture, workflows, and design documentation, please refer to
[`docs/`](../docs/README.md) at the root of this repository.

The OSAC platform provides:

- **Self-service provisioning** for clusters and virtual machines through a governed API
- **Template-based automation** using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
- **Multi-hub support** allowing multiple infrastructure hubs to be managed by a single fulfillment service
- **API access** via both gRPC and REST interfaces for integration with custom tools

This installer uses Helm to manage deployments via an umbrella chart (`charts/osac/`)
with per-environment values files under `values/`.

## OSAC Components

The OSAC platform relies on five core components to deliver governed self-service:

1. **Fulfillment Service:**
   The API and frontend entry point used to manage user requests and map them to specific
   templates.

2. **OSAC Operator:**
   An OpenShift operator residing on the Hub cluster (ACM/OCP-Virt). It orchestrates the
   lifecycle of clusters and VMs by coordinating between the Fulfillment Service and the
   automation backend.

3. **Console Proxy:**
   A Kubernetes aggregated API server that provides serial and VNC console access to
   ComputeInstance VMs. Deployed alongside the operator on each hub.

4. **Automation Backend (AAP):**
   Leverages the **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform** to store and execute the custom
   template logic required for provisioning.

5. **Bare Metal Fulfillment Operator:**
   Kubernetes operator for managing bare-metal host pools. It watches **BareMetalPool**
   custom resources and reconciles them to their desired state by provisioning pools of
   bare-metal hosts organized by host type (e.g., GPU nodes, worker nodes). Uses profile
   templates to configure workflows and apply configuration parameters to selected hosts.
   It also contains a Kubernetes controller that manages bare-metal hosts via OpenStack
   Ironic. It watches **BareMetalInstance** CRs (defined by the Bare Metal Fulfillment Operator)
   and reconciles power state with Ironic.

### Prerequisites & Setup

> **System Requirements** This solution requires the following platforms to be installed
> and operational:
>
> - Red Hat OpenShift Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)
> - Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization (OCP-Virt) - **Optional**: Only required for VM as a Service (VMaaS) support
> - Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)
> - A network backend for bare metal provisioning: **Netris** or agentless
>   (`global.networking` — see [Network Backend Configuration](#network-backend-configuration-caas))

**Configuration Manifests**

The `/prerequisites` directory contains additional manifests required to configure the
target Hub cluster.

> **Warning: Cluster-Wide Impact** If you are using a shared cluster or are not the
> primary administrator, **do not apply these manifests without consultation.** These
> files modify cluster-wide settings. Please coordinate with the appropriate cluster
> administrators before proceeding.

### Prerequisites Summary

| **Category** | **Requirement** | **Notes / Details** |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Platform** | Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.17 or later | Must have cluster admin access to the hub cluster. |
| **Operators** | Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) 2.18+<br>Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization (OCP-Virt) 4.17+<br>Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.5+ | These must be installed and running prior to OSAC installation. |
| **CLI Tools** | `oc` (OpenShift CLI) v4.17+<br>`helm` v3.x<br>`git` | Ensure all CLIs are available in your `PATH`. |
| **Container Registry Access** | `registry.redhat.io` and `quay.io` | Verify credentials and pull secrets are valid in the target cluster namespace. |
| **Network / DNS** | Ingress route configured for OSAC services | Required for external access to fulfillment API and AAP UI. |
| **Authentication / IDM** | Organization Identity Provider (e.g., Keycloak, LDAP, RH-SSO) | Used for tenant and user identity mapping. |
| **Storage** | Dynamic storage class available (e.g., `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs`, `lvms-storage`) | Required for persistence of operator and AAP components. |
| **Permissions** | Cluster-admin access to deploy operators and create CRDs | Limited access users can only deploy into namespaces configured by the admin. |
| **License Files** | `license.zip` (AAP subscription) | Must be placed in your values directory (e.g., `values/<env>/license.zip`). |
| **Internet Access** | Outbound access to GitHub and `ghcr.io` (for fetching chart dependencies, OCI charts, and releases) | Required during installation and updates. |

## Installation

### Obtaining an AAP License (Subscription Manifest)

The AAP license is a **Subscription Manifest** (a `.zip` file), not a key file. To
obtain it:

1. **Log in** to the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/).
2. **Navigate** to **Subscriptions** > **Subscription Allocations**.
3. **Create or select an allocation:** If you haven't created one, click
   "New Subscription Allocation" and set the type (usually "Satellite 6.x").
4. **Add entitlements:** Click on your allocation, go to the **Subscriptions** tab,
   and add your Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions.
5. **Download:** Click **Export Manifest** to download the `.zip` file.

Place the downloaded `license.zip` file in your values directory (e.g., `values/dev/license.zip`).

### Pre-Installation Steps

#### 1. Build Chart Dependencies

In the `osac` mono-repo, component charts are sibling directories referenced via
`file://` in the umbrella `Chart.yaml`. Build dependencies before installing:

```bash
make helm-deps
```

#### 2. Populate Local Secrets

Ensure your values directory contains the necessary secret files:

- **AAP License:** Place `license.zip` in `values/<env>/`
- **Pull Secret:** Place `pull-secret.json` in `values/<env>/`

### Installation

OSAC installs in three phases via `make install`. Each phase's outputs are
the next phase's inputs — this is required because Helm validates all templates
before applying any, and later phases depend on CRDs and secrets that earlier
phases create. See [docs/helm-deployment-guide.md](docs/helm-deployment-guide.md)
for a detailed explanation.

```bash
# Full install (infra + osac)
make install PLATFORM=openshift PROFILE=<profile> NS=<namespace>

# Or run phases individually:
make install-infra PLATFORM=openshift PROFILE=<profile> NS=<namespace>   # Infrastructure (operators, certs, Keycloak)
make install-osac  PLATFORM=openshift PROFILE=<profile> NS=<namespace>   # OSAC application
```

| Variable | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `PLATFORM` | `kind` or `openshift` (required) |
| `PROFILE` | `dev`, `dev-full`, `vmaas-ci`, `bmaas-ci`, `caas-ci`, or `full-ci` (required; `dev-full` is kind only) |
| `NS` | Target namespace (required) |
| `EXTRA_HELM_ARGS` | Extra `--set`/`--set-string` args for the `osac` application release |

#### Deployment MCP PoC on Kind (`PLATFORM=kind`, `PROFILE=dev-full`)

For local development, use the dedicated Kind target. It builds the
fulfillment-service image from the current checkout, loads it into the Kind
cluster, enables MCP at
`https://mcp.osac.localhost:8443`, and installs the normal `dev-full` stack:
KubeVirt, CDI, AWX, a logical `local` storage tier backed by Kind's `standard`
local-path StorageClass, the `linux-vm` ComputeInstance catalog item,
and the ready `tenant1` network.

```bash
make install-mcp-demo PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac
```

No registry push or AAP license is required. The image defaults to
`localhost/fulfillment-service:mcp-demo` and is deployed with
`imagePullPolicy: Never`; each invocation reloads the freshly built image and
restarts the MCP deployment, so reusing the tag is safe while iterating. Set
`MCP_DEMO_IMAGE` only when a different local image name is useful.
The target also reuses an existing `osac-dev` cluster, so it can resume after
a partial installation instead of recreating the local cluster. It also builds
the devstack's AWX Helm dependency automatically, including registering the
required Helm repository; no separate Helm setup command is needed. It also
builds and loads a native local helper image containing `grpcurl`, which the
catalog and tenant hook Jobs need; no registry push is required.
The catalog seed Job mounts the fulfillment API CA and uses verified TLS for
the internal gRPC endpoint; it does not use plaintext or disable certificate
verification. Its `devstack-admin` ServiceAccount mints a short-lived token
for the existing `admin` ServiceAccount, which is configured as the local
private-API administrator; no credential is stored in the chart.

At completion, `install-mcp-demo` prints the MCP endpoint and the optional
one-command Codex setup target:

```bash
make setup-mcp-demo-codex PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac
```

This verifies and saves the local CA, merges the pre-registered OAuth client
and fixed callback into `~/.codex/config.toml` without replacing unrelated
settings, and starts browser login. It preserves an existing OSAC tool-approval
preference, makes a private backup before changing an existing config, and
refuses to overwrite an `osac` entry pointed at another server. On macOS it
also sets CA trust for Codex Desktop in the current login session; restart the
app afterward. A new terminal session still needs the printed
`CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE` export. The setup target requires Python 3.11 or newer.
The complete Codex and browser-OAuth walkthrough is in the
[`MCP demo runbook`](../tools/mcp-oauth-demo-client/RUNBOOK.md).
To launch the optional MCP Inspector with the temporary local CA and the
pre-registered OAuth client configuration, run:

```bash
make mcp-demo-inspector PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac
```

Use the same local Keycloak users as the dev-full UI (`tenant1_user` or
`tenant1_admin` and the `default-user-password` stored in
`keycloak-admin-credentials`). Clients running on the workstation must trust
the local CA:

```bash
kubectl -n osac get configmap ca-bundle -o jsonpath='{.data.bundle\.pem}' \
  > /tmp/osac-ca-bundle.pem

curl --cacert /tmp/osac-ca-bundle.pem \
  https://mcp.osac.localhost:8443/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
```

The Kind runtime is automatically selected on macOS; with Podman, ensure the
Podman machine is running and `podman info` succeeds before invoking the
target. The target uses that user-level Podman connection and does not invoke
`sudo` on macOS. KubeVirt VM execution still depends on the runtime's nested
virtualization support.

#### Full local dev environment (`PROFILE=dev-full`, kind only)

`PROFILE=dev` on kind stands up only the control plane (cert-manager,
envoy-gateway, PostgreSQL, Keycloak, OpenBao, fulfillment-service, operator) —
the same footprint the integration tests use. `PROFILE=dev-full` is a **superset**:
it runs that identical chart-based install, then layers on everything needed for
the end-to-end "create a VM from the UI" experience:

```bash
make install PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac
```

To use source-built images, use the existing component build targets and then
load the resulting image tags into Kind. Use the same `CONTAINER_TOOL` value for
building and loading; the image names must remain registry-qualified so they
match the dev-full Helm values:

```bash
make install-infra PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac

export CONTAINER_TOOL=podman  # Use docker consistently instead if preferred.
make -C ../fulfillment-service image-build \
  IMG=ghcr.io/osac-project/fulfillment-service:latest \
  CONTAINER_TOOL="$CONTAINER_TOOL"
make -C ../osac-operator image-build \
  IMG=ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator:latest \
  CONTAINER_TOOL="$CONTAINER_TOOL"
make -C ../osac-csi-driver image-build \
  IMG=ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-csi-driver:latest \
  CONTAINER_TOOL="$CONTAINER_TOOL"
"$CONTAINER_TOOL" build -t ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-ui:latest \
  -f ../../osac-ui/Containerfile ../../osac-ui

make kind-load-images PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac \
  CONTAINER_TOOL="$CONTAINER_TOOL"
make install-osac PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac
make install-devstack PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac
```

`kind-load-images` only loads already-built images; it does not rebuild them.
After changing source code, rerun the relevant component `image-build` target
and then `kind-load-images`. Loaded images are restarted only for workloads that
use one of the local image references. Each Go component also exposes a
single-image `kind-load-image` target when loading only that component is useful.

On top of `dev`, `dev-full` adds (via `scripts/dev-full/`, orchestrated by the
`install-devstack` target):

`install-devstack` builds and loads a native local helper image for its hook
Jobs. It includes `grpcurl` in addition to the Kubernetes CLI tools, so the
catalog seed uses the fulfillment internal gRPC API reliably on both amd64 and
Apple Silicon Kind clusters. The seed Job verifies the API certificate with the
mounted fulfillment API CA and mints a short-lived `admin` ServiceAccount token
for its private API requests; no helper-image registry push is required.

`dev-full` creates KubeVirt VMs only when the Kind node exposes hardware
virtualization (`devices.kubevirt.io/kvm`). A macOS Podman machine normally
does not expose nested KVM, so it can validate the OSAC request and VM-creation
path but the guest remains `ErrorUnschedulable` with `Insufficient
devices.kubevirt.io/kvm`. Use a Linux host with KVM exposed to the container
runtime for a running guest-VM validation.

By default, the AWX project clones upstream `main`. When validating unmerged
changes to `osac-aap/`, point it at a pushed branch instead:

```bash
make install-devstack PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac \
  DEVSTACK_AWX_PROJECT_URL=https://github.com/<your-fork>/osac.git \
  DEVSTACK_AWX_PROJECT_BRANCH=<your-branch>
```

The configuration hook cleans the AWX checkout before its sync and refreshes
the existing Kubernetes credential, so repeating this command is safe after a
branch change or a failed project update.

- **Virtualization** — Multus CNI + bridge plugin, KubeVirt (operator + CR, `l2bridge`
  binding), CDI
- **AWX** — the open-source AAP backend the operator drives: awx-operator + instance,
  configured with an inventory, a project (`github.com/osac-project/osac.git`,
  playbooks under `osac-aap/`), job templates, a Kubernetes credential, and the
  `awx-token` secret the operator reads
- **OSAC UI** — deployed directly (the chart's `ui.enabled` uses an OpenShift Route,
  unusable on kind) and routed through the shared Envoy Gateway
- **Seeded catalog** — a `fedora` disk image, `u1-small/medium/large` instance types,
  the `osac.templates.ocp_virt_vm` template, and a `linux-vm` catalog item (shared/global
  objects). The template uses the installer-provided `local` storage tier for its boot
  disk. On Kind, that logical tier maps to the built-in `standard` local-path StorageClass;
  `provision-tenant.sh` labels that class for the single `tenant1` tenant. It does not
  require LVMS, an external storage backend, or the tenant-storage controller. Networking
  is per-tenant and auto-provisioned, see below.
- **Ready-to-use tenant** — `provision-tenant.sh` creates a DB tenant (`tenant1`) via the
  private gRPC Tenants API, a matching enabled Keycloak organization, and adds the dev
  users (`tenant1_user`, `tenant1_admin`) as organization members so their tokens carry
  the `organization` claim needed to create resources. Creating the tenant auto-provisions
  its default VirtualNetwork + Subnet + SecurityGroup via tenant onboarding. It also
  seeds the ready `mcp-demo-isolated` VirtualNetwork with the
  `mcp-demo-app-subnet` and `mcp-demo-app-sg` resources, so the MCP demo can show
  a model choosing a non-default network.

The `dev-full` overlay sets `operator.controllers.networkingProvisioning=false` so
networking resources reconcile to READY without a real fabric (Kind has none), and
sets `operator.controllers.storage=false` because the one local tenant is bound directly
to Kind's cluster-scoped `standard` StorageClass. This is deliberately a single-tenant
local-development shortcut, not a storage model for a shared installation.

**Prerequisites** (beyond the base tools) — enforced by `scripts/dev-full/kind-runtime.sh check`:

- A container runtime:
  - **Linux host** — rootful Podman (invoked via `sudo`) or Docker, because
    KubeVirt needs node-level access to `/dev/kvm`; rootless user namespaces
    cannot perform the required device ownership change.
  - **Linux + Distrobox** — the rootful podman host socket (`/run/podman/podman.sock`);
    install the drop-in at `scripts/dev-full/manifests/podman-socket-rootful.conf`
  - **macOS** — Docker Desktop or Podman Desktop. Podman uses your normal
    user-level machine connection; no host-root Podman access is needed. Start
    its machine and verify `podman info` succeeds before installing.
- **`/dev/kvm`** present (Linux), **`fs.inotify.max_user_instances >= 256`**, and
  `kind`, `helm`, `kubectl`, `jq`, `curl`, `openssl`, `python3` on `PATH`
- Override runtime detection with `KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_PROVIDER=docker|podman`.
  On Apple Silicon, an explicit `CONTAINER_TOOL=docker|podman` selects the same
  runtime for installer operations when `KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_PROVIDER` is unset;
  the latter takes precedence when both are provided.

On an Apple Silicon Mac, either Kind profile automatically builds an arm64
replacement for `quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:4.20.0` with the selected
container runtime and loads it into the kind cluster before installing Helm
charts. No manual image setup is required.

`dev-full` uses the normal `ghcr.io/osac-project/...:latest` image references, so
the rendered deployment does not need a development-only registry name. The
profile uses `IfNotPresent`: Kubernetes uses an image loaded in the node and does
not pull it again, while still allowing a partial deployment to pull an image
that has not been built locally.

**Endpoints** (via the kind port mappings; every `*.localhost` name resolves to
127.0.0.1 automatically, so no `/etc/hosts` editing is needed):

- OSAC UI — `http://ui.osac.localhost:8080`
- AWX UI — `http://awx.awx.localhost:8080` (admin password:
  `kubectl -n awx get secret awx-admin-password -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d`)
- Keycloak — `https://keycloak.osac.localhost:8443`
- OSAC API — `https://fulfillment-api.osac.localhost:8443` (TLS Passthrough, SNI via Envoy)
- OSAC private CLI API — `https://fulfillment-internal-api.osac.svc.cluster.local:8443`.
  Add `127.0.0.1 fulfillment-internal-api.osac.svc.cluster.local` to `/etc/hosts`
  first; the internal name is required for TLS certificate verification.

**Log in** to the UI as `tenant1_user` (or `tenant1_admin`). The password is the
Keycloak dev-fixtures `default-user-password`:
`kubectl -n keycloak get secret keycloak-admin-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.default-user-password}' | base64 -d`.
Both users are members of the `tenant1` organization, so they can immediately create
compute instances on the auto-provisioned default network.

Tear down everything (including the kind cluster, via the same runtime wrapper):

```bash
make uninstall PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=osac
```

#### Configure Values

Each profile has two values files under `values/<profile>/`:

```bash
mkdir -p values/<project-name>
cp values/dev/infra.yaml values/<project-name>/infra.yaml
cp values/dev/instance.yaml values/<project-name>/instance.yaml
# Edit to match your cluster (see values file comments for guidance)
```

Prerequisites (cert-manager, AAP, LVMS, MetalLB, CNV, MCE) are installed
automatically by Phase 1. Each is gated by a values toggle (for example,
`certManager.enabled: true`). See
[prerequisites/README.md](prerequisites/README.md) for details on what each
prerequisite provides.

#### AAP Configuration

AAP instance groups carry backend credentials for provisioning jobs.
Configure via Helm values under `aap.instanceGroups.*` in your values file.

See [docs/aap-configuration.md](docs/aap-configuration.md) for details.

#### Network Backend Configuration (CaaS)

Default networking is agentless (`global.networking.fabricManager: ""`,
`k8sManager: k8s_only`). For **Netris**, set the facade and enable both AAP
instance groups:

```yaml
global:
  networking:
    fabricManager: netris
    k8sManager: ""
    netris:
      controllerUrl: "https://redhat-ctl.netris.io"
      credentials:
        username: "netris"
        externalSecret: true
      siteId: "5"
      tenantId: "1"
      tenantName: "Admin"

aap:
  instanceGroups:
    clusterFulfillment:
      enabled: true
    networkFulfillment:
      enabled: true
```

Helm derives `NETWORK_CLASS`, manager ConfigMaps, and the default NetworkClass
from this block. Do not set those by hand unless using expert overrides.

See [docs/network-backend.md](docs/network-backend.md) for profiles,
credentials, and the advanced/manual path.

#### DNS Backend Configuration (CaaS)

DNS record management uses a pluggable backend. The default is **AWS Route 53**.

See [docs/dns-backend.md](docs/dns-backend.md) for backend details, the
interface contract, and how to add a new provider.

#### Verify

```bash
helm status osac -n <project-name>
oc get pods -n <project-name>
oc logs -f job/osac-aap-bootstrap -n <project-name>
```

#### Upgrading

```bash
helm upgrade osac charts/osac/ \
  --namespace <project-name> \
  --values values/<project-name>/values.yaml \
  --timeout 40m \
  --wait
```

The post-upgrade hook re-publishes cluster templates automatically. This is
idempotent - existing templates are updated via PATCH while new templates
are created via POST.

#### Uninstalling

```bash
make uninstall
```

> **Note:** CRDs are preserved after uninstall (they have the
> `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` annotation). To remove them manually:
> `oc delete crd -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=osac`

#### Makefile Targets

```bash
make install       PLATFORM=... PROFILE=... NS=...  # Full install (infra + osac)
make install-infra PLATFORM=... PROFILE=... NS=...  # Infrastructure only
make install-osac  PLATFORM=... PROFILE=... NS=...  # OSAC application only
make kind-load-images PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev-full NS=... # Load existing images
make uninstall     PLATFORM=... PROFILE=... NS=...  # Full uninstall
make test          PLATFORM=... PROFILE=... NS=... SUITE=...  # Integration tests
make helm-lint                                       # Lint all charts
make helm-template       # Dry-run render all templates
make helm-validate                                   # Lint + template (full validation)
make sync-charts         # Rebuild chart dependencies (legacy alias; runs helm dependency build)
```

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Monitor pod creation and startup
$ watch oc get -n <project-name> pods
```

Once `helm install` completes successfully (including all post-install hooks),
OSAC is ready for use. Cluster templates are published automatically by a
post-install hook that runs after the AAP bootstrap job.

## OSAC CLI: Setup & Usage

To install the CLI and register a hub, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the Binary

Download the latest release and make it executable.

```bash
# Adjust URL for the latest version as needed
$ curl -L -o osac \
    https://github.com/osac-project/fulfillment-service/releases/latest/download/osac_Linux_x86_64
$ chmod +x osac

# Optional: Move to your path
$ sudo mv osac /usr/local/bin/
```

### 2. Log in to the Service

Authenticate with the fulfillment API. You will need the route address and a valid
token generation script.

```bash
$ osac login \
    --address <your-fulfillment-route-url> \
    --token-script "oc create token fulfillment-controller -n <project-name> \
    --duration 1h --as system:admin" \
    --insecure
```

> **Tip:** Retrieve your route URL using: `oc get routes -n <project-name>`

### 3. Register the Hub

To allow the OSAC operator to communicate with the fulfillment service, you must
obtain the kubeconfig and register the hub. The script located at
`scripts/create-hub-access-kubeconfig.sh` demonstrates how to generate the kubeconfig
for a hub.

```bash
# Generate the kubeconfig
$ ./scripts/create-hub-access-kubeconfig.sh

# Register the Hub
$ osac create hub \
    --kubeconfig=kubeconfig.hub-access \
    --id <hub-name> \
    --namespace <project-name>
```

### 4. Use the CLI

Once configured, you can use the OSAC CLI to manage clusters and virtual machines.
For detailed usage instructions and command reference, see
[OSAC-CLI-HOWTO.md](OSAC-CLI-HOWTO.md).

## Accessing Ansible Automation Platform

After deployment, you can access the AAP web interface to monitor jobs and manage automation:

### Get the AAP URL

```bash
oc get route -n <project-name> | grep osac-aap
```

> **Note:** The main AAP URL will be something like: `https://osac-aap-<project-name>.apps.your-cluster.com`

### Get the AAP Admin Password

```bash
# Extract the admin password
$ oc extract secret/osac-aap-admin-password -n <project-name> --to -
```

### Login to AAP

- Open the AAP controller URL in your browser
- Username: `admin`
- Password: (from the previous step)

### AAP API Token

The OSAC operator requires an API token to communicate with AAP. The
`create-api-token` Helm hook creates this automatically during `make install-osac`.
The token is stored in the `osac-aap-api-token` Secret.

## Tearing Down OSAC

To completely remove an OSAC deployment and all its prerequisites, use the teardown script:

```bash
# Using defaults (namespace: osac)
$ ./scripts/teardown.sh

# Or specify your namespace
$ INSTALLER_NAMESPACE=<project-name> ./scripts/teardown.sh

# Include all optional services in teardown (must match what was used during setup)
$ EXTRA_SERVICES=true INSTALLER_NAMESPACE=<project-name> ./scripts/teardown.sh
```

The script removes resources in reverse order:

1. OSAC CRs (while operator is running for finalizer processing)
2. Helm release and project namespace
3. Keycloak
4. AAP operator
5. Multicluster Engine and AgentServiceConfig (if `MCE_SERVICE=true`)
6. OpenShift Virtualization (if `VIRT_SERVICE=true`)
7. LVMS storage service (if `STORAGE_SERVICE=true`)
8. MetalLB ingress service (if `INGRESS_SERVICE=true`)
9. CA issuer, trust-manager, and cert-manager
10. Stale API services and CRD cleanup

> **Warning:** This removes **all** prerequisite operators and their namespaces. If other
> workloads on the cluster depend on these operators (e.g., cert-manager, MetalLB), do not
> run this script. Instead, manually uninstall:
>
> ```bash
> helm uninstall osac -n <project-name>
> oc delete namespace <project-name>
> ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **cert-manager not ready**: Ensure cert-manager operator is installed and running
2. **Certificate issues**: Check cert-manager logs and certificate status
3. **ImagePullBackOff errors**: Verify registry credentials and image string
4. **Cluster templates missing or incomplete**: Cluster templates are published
   automatically by a Helm post-install hook (`osac-publish-templates`). If
   `osac get clustertemplates` returns missing or unexpected results, check the
   hook pod logs:
   `oc logs job/osac-publish-templates -n <project-name>`.
   See [docs/helm-deployment-guide.md](docs/helm-deployment-guide.md#template-publish-hook-failing)
   for details.
