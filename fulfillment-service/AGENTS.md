# Fulfillment service

gRPC and REST APIs, persistence, authorization, resource lifecycle, and the
`osac` CLI.

This component is part of the OSAC monorepo, not an isolated project. Its APIs,
generated artifacts, deployment configuration, and runtime behavior may affect
other components. Apply the repository-wide rules in
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), consider downstream consumers before changing
behavior, and follow the instructions for every affected component.

## Required context

Before changing this component, identify the documents relevant to the change
below, then read and follow them. These documents are authoritative for their
respective areas.

- API or proto work: [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) and [`docs/CLEANAPI.md`](docs/CLEANAPI.md)
- API or CLI request input changes:
  [`docs/REQUEST_PATH_TRACING.md`](docs/REQUEST_PATH_TRACING.md). Trace the path
  from the user-facing entry point through routing, filtering, and
  transformation layers to the handler.
- Authentication/authorization: [`docs/AUTH.md`](docs/AUTH.md)
- Database or request lifecycle: [`docs/CODEWALK.md`](docs/CODEWALK.md)
- Deployment and local setup: [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) and [`README.md`](README.md)
- CLI-specific conventions: [`internal/cmd/cli/AGENTS.md`](internal/cmd/cli/AGENTS.md)

## Invariants

- The proto contract lives in the top-level `proto/` module, not here. `proto/private/` is the API source of truth; `proto/tests/` contains editable test-only definitions.
- Never edit `proto/public/` or `proto/gen/` manually; `proto/tests/` is editable test-proto source. Generated Go is one shared tree at `proto/gen/`, imported by every module as `github.com/osac-project/osac/proto/gen/...`.
- Express field and cross-field validation with proto validation annotations when possible, not duplicated Go checks.
- Base resource messages follow the custom `OSAC_OBJECT_SHAPE` rule. An intentional exception requires `// buf:lint:ignore OSAC_OBJECT_SHAPE` directly above the message.
- Update validation operates on the stored object after applying the update mask, not on the partial request alone.
- Public servers wrap private servers and add tenant/auth behavior; preserve that boundary.
- Existing database migrations are immutable. Add a new numbered migration instead of changing an applied one.
- Tenant authorization and attribution must remain enforced on every public resource path.

## Generated files

- Proto changes are regenerated ONCE, in the top-level `proto/` module: `make -C ../proto generate` (= `uv run dev.py build protos` for `proto/public/` + `buf generate` for `proto/gen/`). `make -C ../proto lint` runs `buf lint`. No more per-consumer `buf generate`.
- Commit the `proto/private/` (or `proto/tests/`) source, the regenerated `proto/public/`, and the regenerated `proto/gen/`. CI (`Check generated code (proto)`) fails the PR if `proto/gen/` or `proto/public/` is stale.
- Test-only proto changes under `proto/tests/` still regenerate `proto/gen/` but not `proto/public/`.
- Run `go generate ./...` here for mocks and other `go:generate` outputs; run `go mod tidy` after module changes.
- Never hand-edit `proto/public/`, `proto/gen/`, `*_mock.go`, or `go.sum`.

## Validation

Run these checks from `fulfillment-service/` as applicable.

### Local checks

```bash
uv run dev.py lint
uv run ruff check
helm lint charts/service -f charts/service/ci-values.yaml
helm template test charts/service -f charts/service/ci-values.yaml
go build ./cmd/fulfillment-service ./cmd/osac
ginkgo run -r internal
```

`ginkgo run -r internal` runs the unit suites without `it/`. For a focused
server run, use `ginkgo run internal/servers`.

### Integration tests

See the [fulfillment-service test tiers and coverage notes](../docs/INTEGRATION-TESTING.md#fulfillment-service).

The installer test target builds, loads, and deploys the current service image.
It reuses the existing cluster and database. For a full suite run, use a fresh
environment unless the user agrees to reuse the database. See `README.md` for
prerequisites and host entries.

The `it/` suite includes CLI workflows that exercise only Fulfillment Service
APIs. Its harness builds the CLI from this checkout and runs it against the
deployed service. Catalog Item API behavior, CLI creation, and the ClusterOrder
release image written by Fulfillment are checked in `it/`. Keep cross-component
provisioning journeys under `tests/e2e/`.

The MCP SDK spec in `it/` starts its HTTP handler in-process and calls the
deployed public Fulfillment API with each user's token. It covers public API
authorization and persistence, while chart renders cover opt-in deployment
shape. It does not exercise a deployed MCP route or TLS handshake.

To prepare a fresh environment, recreate the dedicated `osac-dev` Kind
cluster. Collect useful diagnostics before deleting it.

```bash
kind delete cluster --name osac-dev
make -C ../osac-installer install-infra PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev NS=osac
```

Then run the suite:

```bash
make -C ../osac-installer test PLATFORM=kind PROFILE=dev NS=osac SUITE=fulfillment
```
